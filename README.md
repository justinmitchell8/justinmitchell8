Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my MD in high energy particle physics at Southern University A&M College
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI agent automation, how to code c++, simulate particle interactions in detectors to increase efficiency, japanese, new methods of multimessenger astronomy detection
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any astroparticle physics projects/ AI integration with astrophysics
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding in c++, resume building skills/ techincal skills, jobs/ collaboration
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything your curious about, don't be afraid to pick my brain!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: via email, social media, LinkedIn, github, any method is fine
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have about 4 hobbies and counting: photography, painting/drawing, studing japanese, music production. And now building a J.A.R.V.I.S. modeled AI assistant
